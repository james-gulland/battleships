<h1>Project One: Battleships</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>

The first GA Software Engineering immersive course project was in week 4 of the course, with the brief of creating a Battleships game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  I learnt a lot about streamlined, readable, and reusable code, by implementing objects, functions and methods in JavaScript, as well as had some fun with HTML5 and CSS techniques.
